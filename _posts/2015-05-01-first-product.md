*Analog gauge reader for residential and commercial propane tanks.  While products exist in this market, they are expensive, slow to setup, complex to use, and respond to customer needs at a slow pace -- great market conditions to attack!*\\

The problem was that propane is not used much in Washington state, where I live.  According to the [Energy Information Administration](http://www.eia.gov), Washington state is ranked 34th in its use of propane as a percentage of all non-vehicle fuels used.  Additionally, of the 3.2 billion BTUs of propane consumed in the United States in 2013, [just six states, Texas, Kansas, Lousiana, Iowa, Vermont, and New Hampshire, consume 74% of it](#modal1){:data-toggle="modal"}.  It didn't make much sense to start a business to serve a market no where near me.
