*Bring combined sensor and SaaS technology to industries that have been slow to benefit from the rapid pace of technology innovation over the past decade.*\\
\\
Industries like oil and gas, construction, forestry, and fisheries have not benefited from technological innovation as much as service-based industries -- or industries where software is used to complete day-to-day activities.  The "analog" industries require physical hardware to interface their work with the software world.  But hardware development is too expensive, too complex, and iteration takes too long compared to software development.\\
\\
Hardware development is changing.  Prototyping cycles have shortened, parts can be ordered in small quantities cost effectively, and there has been a surge in simple-to-program microcontrollers.  The surge in Internet of Things consumer devices and services is one result of these changes.  However the path to profit in Internet of Things consumer applications is not very clear.  Are people really willing to pay a monthly service fee for their refrigerator?

There is a much more clear value proposition for Internet of Things innovations for businesses, but more specifically, "analog" businesses.  Operational efficiency, risk mitigation,
